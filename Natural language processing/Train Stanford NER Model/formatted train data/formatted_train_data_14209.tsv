just	O
,	O
go	O
for	O
it	O
.	O
women	O
in	O
startups	O
face	O
some	O
real	O
challenges	O
that	O
should	O
n't	O
be	O
there	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
does	O
n't	O
mean	O
they	O
're	O
not	O

there	O

who	O
are	O
trying	O
to	O

the	O
playing	O
field	O
.	O
my	O
second	O
thought	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
as	O
selective	O
and	O
thoughtful	O
as	O
you	O
can	O
about	O
who	O
you	O
work	O
with	O
.	O
the	O
people	O
we	O
work	O
with	O
determine	O
how	O
much	O
we	O
achieve	O
and	O
how	O
happy	O
we	O
are	O
doing	O
it	O
.	O
so	O
be	O
deliberate	O
and	O
ambitious	O
about	O
choosing	O
your	O
colleagues	O
,	O
whether	O
you	O
're	O
evaluating	O

a	O

what	O
is	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
lesson	O
you	O
've	O
learned	O
in	O
your	O
career	O
to	O
date	O
?	O
inevitably	O
,	O
in	O
startups	O
and	O
probably	O
any	O
job	O

throw	O
yourself	O

yourself	O

a	O
