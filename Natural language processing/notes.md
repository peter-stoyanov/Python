- A token is the technical name for a sequence of characters — such as hairy, his, or :) — that we want to treat as a group

- words that occur once only, the so-called hapaxes
- A collocation is a sequence of words that occur together unusually often (red wine)
- word pairs, also known as bigrams
- A word "token" is a particular appearance of a given word in a text; a word "type" is the unique form of the word as a particular sequence of letters. We count word tokens using len(text) and word types using len(set(text)).
